### Hey!ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!âœ¨

My name is Amy! Glad we connected today. I'm a software engineer ready to take on full-stack web development projects. I thrive working in React.js and enjoy playing in the backend making CRUD operations. I enjoy finding creative ways to display information on a fun, interactive website. I have over five years of marketing experience that has been essential in how I design websites.
