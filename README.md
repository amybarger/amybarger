### Hey!ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!âœ¨

My name is Amy! Glad we connected today. I'm a junior data analyst who found my love for the field as I discovered it in a software engineering role. 

When it comes to computer programming, I thrive working in React.js and enjoy playing in the backend making CRUD operations. In my data analyst journey, learning R programming language and making SQL query calls was a breeze as I had programming experience with the skills I gained at Bloom Institute of Technology (formerly known as Lambda School). I enjoy the creative process of finding solutions through data and visuals. It's the perfect marriage for my love of data and design. I have over five years of marketing experience that has been a great addition to my career and skillset.
